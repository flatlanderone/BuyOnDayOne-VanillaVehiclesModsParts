## Buy On Day One - Vanilla Vehicles, Mods and Parts
Buy On Day One - Vanilla Vehicles, Mods and Parts lets you buy all vanilla vehicles, vehicle mods and vehicle parts from each trader starting on your first day in the zombie apocalypse. 

## Important Notes 
1. If you install any of the Buy On Day One mods in an existing world, you must reset the trader's inventory using console commands or wait for the trader to reset according to his normal schedule.
2. Not tested in multiplayer.
3. The mods should not affect other vehicle mods (to be confirmed).
4. Removing the mods is probably safe, but you probably should reset the trader's inventory using console commands or wait for the trader to reset according to his normal schedule.
