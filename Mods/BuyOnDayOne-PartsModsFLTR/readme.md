# Buy On Day One - Vehicle Parts and Mods for 7 Days To Die v2

1. **Buy On Day One - Vehicle Parts and Mods** lets you buy all vanilla vehicle parts and vehicle mods starting on your first day in the zombie apocalypse. 

2. All traders carry **bicycle** and **minibike** parts.

3. Trader Bob has also all the parts for the Motorcycle, the 4x4 Truck, and the Gyrocopter and all the vehicle mods.

4. Traders will NOT carry complete vehicles.

# Important notes

1. If you install any of the [Buy On Day One mods](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/flatlanderone/mods) in an existing world, you must reset the trader's inventory using console commands or wait for the trader to reset according to his normal schedule.

2. Not tested in multiplayer.

3. The mods should not affect other vehicle mods (to be confirmed).

4. Removing the mods is probably safe, but you should always make a backup of your game save and reset the trader's inventory using console commands or wait for the trader to reset according to his normal schedule.
